Any author (user can edit posts) can set its own default category on his profil page.

== Description ==

A basic default category plugin. 
The main purpose of this plugin is to provide different default categories on a per user basis.

I was looking for a plugin to set a different default category for my flickr posts (through XMLRPC API). 
And there was no built-in function to set a default category to a particular user.

This plugin is very simple :

* any author can set it's own default category (user can `edit_posts`)
* any admin can modify an author default category (user can `edit_user`)
* anywhere in WordPress a user get it's default category where applicable : posts, API posts, â€¦ except in the writing settings page
